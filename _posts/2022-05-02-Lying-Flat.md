title: "'Lying Flat' Movement: Performativity and Alternative Strategy"
layout: post
---

This project was advised by Professor Leo Ching of Duke University. This project investigates the mechanism of the production and
development of the notion “lying flat” in China. I argue that it is not a political movement or a “resistance” but one of the coping
mechanisms to collective feelings of anxiety, “neijuan” (social involution), in the context of neoliberalism 
in post-socialist China. Worked as a gesture, it is highly performative and ritualized by the creation of
memes and buzzwords. Following Laurent Berlant’s argument of cruel optimism, I argue that “lying flat”
as a “joyful pessimism”, tries to take failure as an alternative strategy when facing an ordinary crisis.
