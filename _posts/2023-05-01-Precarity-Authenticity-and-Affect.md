This project was advised by Professor Carlos Rojas of Duke University. 
My thesis explores the production, circulation, and reception of two visual practices in Chinese
digital media: short videos and live streaming. Under the theoretical framework of Marxism, critical
media studies, and affect theory, I propose several features of these new media practices in comparison
with film and television shows: the goal to make monetary use of attention, the construction of
participatory culture, and the development of a novel form of engagement through mobile devices. The
combination of synchronous and asynchronous spectatorship brings interactivity, which affectively
constructs relationships between content producers and audiences. I argue that these content producersâ€™
performative authenticity and narration of precarity all elicit connectedness, friendship, and even
solidarity with their audiences.
