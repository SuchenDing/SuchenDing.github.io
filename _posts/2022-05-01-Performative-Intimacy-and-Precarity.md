title: "Performative Intimacy and Precarity: “Just Chatting” Live Streaming in China"
layout: post
---

This paper was advised by Professor Anne Allison of Duke Cultural Anthrology. This paper adopts affective labor and places it into the
context of precarity to analyze the “Just Chatting” live streaming performance on Douyu. Precarity is registered in streamers’ financial,
social status, and cultural belonging, the censorship from the platform and state, and the feature of digital labor. By
analyzing the performance, I argue that the affective dimensions of live streaming provide viewers
intimacy, attachment, and companionship. However, these feelings are performative and need money to
maintain and develop, making them illusory. In this process, streamers and viewers have reached a
consensus on a relationship under capital control. I argue that performative intimacy strengthens the
precarity of live streamers but also embodies a new kind of hope and embraces a new possibility to
construct an alliance and compensation for reality.
