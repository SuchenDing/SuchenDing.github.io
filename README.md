My name is Suchen Ding, and I am thrilled to have the opportunity to share my background and experiences with you. Currently residing in Irvine, CA, I am an ambitious individual driven by a passion for Film and Media Studies. As I embark on my journey to pursue a PhD in this field at the prestigious University of California, Irvine, starting in August 2023, I am excited to delve deeper into the realms of visual storytelling and its impact on society.

My educational background is rooted in a pursuit of knowledge and understanding. I recently completed my Master's degree in Critical Asian Humanities at Duke University in Durham, NC. During my time there, I achieved a remarkable GPA of 3.97/4.00, demonstrating my dedication to academic excellence. My MA thesis, titled "(Self-)Representation of Migrant Workers in Chinese Smaller-screen Visual Practices," explored the power of media in shaping our perceptions of marginalized communities. Prior to my time at Duke, I obtained a Bachelor's degree in Chinese Language and Literature from Wuhan University in Wuhan, China. My honors BA thesis on the conceptual construction of 'Modern Girls' in 1930s Shanghai showcased my ability to conduct in-depth research and critically analyze cultural phenomena.

I have also gained valuable professional experience throughout my journey. As an Instructor at Universe Beyond Education in Shenzhen, China, I effectively taught high-level International Baccalaureate and A-level Chinese language and literature courses. My mentoring efforts resulted in significant improvements in student grades, and I provided valuable consultation services to parents to ensure student success.

During my time as a Teaching Assistant at Duke University, I graded student assignments and conducted individual oral practice sessions to help students improve their Chinese language speaking skills. Additionally, I assisted professors with lesson planning and organized classroom teaching, showcasing my ability to contribute to an engaging and supportive learning environment.

I further honed my skills as an Editorial Intern at Renwu Magazine in Beijing, where I edited digital images and proofread stories, providing detailed feedback to writers. I also authored articles and newsletters, resulting in a substantial viewership. Additionally, as a New Media Editorial Intern at NetEase Inc., I managed social media platforms, created engaging content, and produced reports for decision-making purposes. These experiences have not only enhanced my communication and writing skills but also allowed me to engage with a wide range of audiences.

Furthermore, as the Editor-in-Chief of Literary Journal Luojia Wenjing in Wuhan, I provided editorial support, mentored writers, and hosted training sessions. My own fiction prose, short stories, and personal essays were also published during this time, allowing me to express my creativity and connect with readers on a deeper level.

In recognition of my achievements, I have been the recipient of several awards, including a tuition grant from Duke University, the National Scholarship from the Ministry of Education of China, and the First Class Scholarship from Wuhan University. These accolades serve as a testament to my hard work, dedication, and commitment to academic excellence.

Beyond my educational and professional pursuits, I am multilingual, fluent in Mandarin as my native language, proficient in English, and possess a basic understanding of Spanish. These language proficiencies enable me to connect with diverse individuals and contribute to a global dialogue.

In conclusion, I am excited to embark on the next phase of my academic journey and explore the vast world of Film and Media Studies at the University of California, Irvine. I am enthusiastic about meeting new people, forging meaningful connections, and advancing both personally and professionally. I look forward to contributing to the field and making a positive impact on society through my research and storytelling abilities.

Thank you for taking the time to get to know me better. I am eager to connect with all of you and embrace the endless possibilities that lie ahead in our lives and careers.
