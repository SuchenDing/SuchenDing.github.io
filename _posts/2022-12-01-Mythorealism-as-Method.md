title: "Mythorealism as Methods: Fictionality and Historicity in Shou Huo"
layout: post

This project was advised by Professor Carlos Rojas of Duke University. 
By doing a textual analysis of Shou Huo as a political allegory, 
I argue that there are incoherence and gaps within its narrative. 
Yan Lianke intentionally adopts “mythorealism” as his writing methodology,
which can be explained as the strategy to adapt the censorship and the internal mechanism of traumatic
narration. Thus, I argue that the methodology of “mythorealism” is essential to transcend the bridge
between historicity and fictionality.
