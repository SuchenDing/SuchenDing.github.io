This project was advised by Professor Ralph Litzinger of Duke University. 
This project investigates the role that digital media plays in three significant events during the outbreak of
the Covid-19 pandemic in China: the Wuhan lockdown (2020.1-2020.4), the Shanghai lockdown (2022.2-
2022.8), and the social protests towards “zero-Covid” policies (2022.11). Digital media, including devices
and communication technologies, provide a space for representation and action when facing the global
ecological crisis. Based on the materiality of media, this paper argues that these media events embody the
feature of mobility, transnationality, and temporality, which lead to the affective dimension of digital
media and bring self-expression and social resistance. By analyzing the practices such as the mundanity
use of digital media, the construction of digital affect culture, the sousveillance, and creative anticensorship
practices, this paper provides the alternative possibilities of resistance outside the Western
democratic imagination.
